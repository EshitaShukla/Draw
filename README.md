# Draw

Draw is a simple Artificial Intelligence experiment to check if a neural network running on Android can recognize what you are doodling. To make it more fun, there is an entire game wrapped around the neural network. 

On each attempt, you'll be given 1 chance to draw 8 different objects. The objects will be chosen randomly from over 100 objects.
